        "* Describe the single-threaded, event-driven architecture of Node.js\n",
        "\n",
        "Node.js runs your JavaScript code in one main thread—the event loop thread.\n",
        "This means:\n",
        "\n",
        "Only one piece of JS code runs at a time\n",
        "\n",
        "There is no multi-threaded execution of JS like in Java or C++\n",
        "\n",
        "No need to worry about thread locks, deadlocks, or race conditions\n",
        "\n",
        "But even though Node.js is single-threaded, it can still handle thousands of concurrent operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How does Node.js achieve concurrency with one thread?\n",
        "\n",
        "Through its event-driven, non-blocking I/O mod\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Event-Driven Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "Node.js uses an event loop to manage operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Your program starts in the main (single) thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whenever you make an async request (like file read, API call, DB query), Node:\n",
        "\n",
        "Delegates it to the libuv thread pool or OS\n",
        "\n",
        "Continues executing other code\n",
        "\n",
        "When the operation finishes, Node triggers a callback/event\n",
        "\n",
        "The event loop picks up the callback and runs it in the main thread\n",
        "\n",
        "This is how Node handles many operations without waiting for each one to finish.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Non-blocking I/O\n",
        "\n",
        "Node.js never blocks the main thread while waiting for slow operations like:\n",
        "\n",
        "File system access\n",
        "\n",
        "Database queries\n",
        "\n",
        "Network calls\n",
        "\n",
        "Timers\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Why is this architecture suitable for I/O-heavy applications?\n",
        "Because Node.js uses non-blocking, asynchronous I/O, its single thread never waits for slow operations like database queries, API calls, or file reads.\n",
        "Instead, these tasks run in the background, and the event loop handles the results when they're ready.\n",
        "\n",
        "This lets Node.js efficiently handle thousands of concurrent I/O requests without creating new threads, making it fast and scalable for I/O-heavy apps.\n"
